# Symbiosis recovery dynamics after bleaching in *Montipora capitata*

### Author: Ross Cunning
### Description:
This R project contains data and scripts to analyze recovery dynamics of *Symbiodinium* in *Montipora capitata* corals following a thermal stress event in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu (Hawaii, USA) in late summer 2014. Corals were tagged and resampled 6 times between October 2014 and May 2015, and extracted DNA from each sample was used to measure symbiont to host cell ratios for both clade C and clade D *Symbiodinium*.
